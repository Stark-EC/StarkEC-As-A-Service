Its regulatory activities are, among others, based on the Kreditwesengesetz (KWG &#x2013; &#x2018;Banking Act&#x2019;), which sets out guidelines for banks operating in the country. However, BaFin&#x2019;s responsibilities reach beyond banking to monitor almost all financial service providers with German locations, including banks, brokerage firms, and insurers.</p><p>Due to the German federal system, the organization oversees institutions that operate across state borders within the country - local authorities monitor providers that work within a single state. The largest banks fall under the purview of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, in other words, EU-level oversight. BaFin is tasked with regulating and monitoring activities between these two administrative levels, encompassing most financial services in the country.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-implications-of-not-complying-with-the-kwg-or-bafin-guidelines">What are the implications of not complying with the KWG or BaFin guidelines?</h3><p>The KWG sets out several reporting and auditing requirements for banks and brokerage firms. BaFin is responsible for monitoring how firms comply with these requirements. Beyond this, BaFin may create norm-interpreting binding regulations that flesh out the technical details of provisions only controlled at a higher level in various laws.</p><p>BaFin has a range of options at its disposal to carry out its supervisory duties, including compulsory reports, audits, and pre-announced or surprise on-site visits. Companies found to be non-compliant can be disciplined in various ways.</p><p>Primarily, BaFin will work with companies to resolve any identified problems. In more severe cases, it may take official action in the form of written notices (known as &#x2018;serious objections&#x2019;), cease and desist orders, administrative fines. In extreme events, BaFin can install caretakers to take over the management of a financial service provider or revoke operating licenses entirely.</p><p>BaFin is required to <a href="file://tresoritdrive_bc1ccbe14b5ffd96354e6976478ebcca.drive.tresorit.com/Users/darcy.mitchell/Library/CloudStorage/Tresorit-DarcyMitchell/For%20Daniel%20/BaFin%20&amp;%20KWG%20%202/draft/%5bhttps:/www.bafin.de/SiteGlobals/Forms/Suche/EN/Expertensuche/_Formular.html?cl2Categories\_Format=Massnahme&amp;gts=dateOfIssue\_dt+desc&amp;documentType\_=News&amp;sortOrder=dateOfIssue\_dt+desc&amp;language\_=en%5d">publish a list</a> of offending institutions and disciplinary measures on its website.

However, ensuring compliance and legality are still a main barrier to adoption. Qualified electronic signatures (QES) as defined by the Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC (eIDAS)&#xA0;are the most secure form of eSignatures &#x2014; the gold standard for ensuring legal effect and compliance.

<p></p><h3 id="ses-vs-aes-vs-qes-the-different-types-of-electronic-signatures-explained">SES vs. AES vs. QES: the different types of electronic signatures, explained</h3><p>In the European Union, the eIDAS sets forth the requirements of electronic signatures. The European signature framework has been established to further digitalization and facilitate cross-border transactions within the region. It helps businesses transact safer, faster and more efficiently upon mutually accepted signature schemes. It also defines legality criteria for electronic signatures, meaning that businesses who rely on electronic signatures issued by trust services complying with the highest standards of eIDAS have a legally safe position in court proceedings.</p><p>As defined under eIDAS based on security and verification requirements, electronic signatures fall into three categories: simple, advanced, and qualified electronic signatures (SES, AES, and QES, respectively). Let&#x2019;s see how these differ in terms of security features, authentication processes, and legal standings.</p><p><strong>1. Simple electronic signatures (SES)</strong> are the most basic form of e-signatures. They can be anything from scanned images of a person&#x2019;s ink signature through a typed name at the end of an email to any electronic process that signifies an approval. SES is widely used for its ease and convenience in less critical scenarios where the risks and legal implications are minimal.</p><p><strong>2. Advanced electronic signatures (AES)</strong>, a step up from SES, include unique identification features that are exclusively linked to the signatory. Advanced electronic signatures are not only capable of identifying the signatory but can also detect any subsequent changes to the signed document.</p><p>AES requires a higher level of security and assurance about the signatory&#x2019;s identity than SES. For example, it involves digital certificates that are cryptographically linked to the signatory. However, it still lacks some of the stringent security and verification measures required for the most critical documents. As such, the evidential value of documents signed with AES &#xA0;is not harmonized across all EU member states. In other words, their probative value can be questioned in proceedings when certain formal requirements as defined by national laws are not met.</p><p><strong>3. Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)</strong> are the most secure and legally-binding form of electronic signatures, perceived to be equivalent to handwritten signatures. They provide the highest level of assurance among e-signatures, ensuring both the integrity and the non-repudiation of the signed document, along with minimal environmental impact and enhanced operational efficiency.</p><p>A qualified electronic signature requires face-to-face verification of the signatory&#x2019;s identity or equivalent electronic identification means. It also necessitates the use of a secure signature creation device (SSCD) and a certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider (QTSP). Given the robust security measures involved, qualified electronic signatures are recognized with the same legal status as handwritten signatures across the EU, making them suitable for high-stake transactions and documents.</p><h3 id="fast-safe-legally-binding-key-qes-benefits-you-don%E2%80%99t-want-to-miss-out-on">Fast, safe, legally-binding &#xA0;key QES benefits you don&#x2019;t want to miss out on</h3><p><strong>Legality and compliance</strong></p><p>QES, under eIDAS, provides a legal framework that ensures signed documents have the same legal standing as their handwritten counterparts. This legal acknowledgement extends across borders within the EU, facilitating seamless international transactions and cooperation.</p><p><strong>Security and authentication</strong></p><p>Qualified electronic signatures rely on robust encryption techniques and unique identification features, eliminating the risks of forgery and unauthorized access. This level of security is paramount in healthcare, finance, or any sector where the integrity and confidentiality of documents are non-negotiable.</p><p><strong>Efficiency &amp; sustainability</strong></p><p>Qualified electronic signatures eliminate the need for physical document handling, significantly reducing the time for document processing and exchange. This not only speeds up operations but also lowers operational costs associated with printing, storage, and delivery of paper documents.</p><p>QES can also help organizations contribute to reducing paper consumption and waste, aligning with broader environmental sustainability goals, by adopting fully digital document workflows and signing processes.</p><h3 id="how-to-obtain-a-certified-digital-signature-in-4-steps">How to obtain a certified digital signature in 4 steps</h3><p>Obtaining a qualified electronic signature involves a series of steps to ensure the highest level of security and legal compliance:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to <b>select a qualified trust service provider (QTSP)</b> that is recognized within the European Union. The list of QTSPs is publicly available among the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-trusted-lists?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" ref="nofollow">EU Trusted Lists</a>.
</li>
  <li>Once a qualified trust service provider is selected, the <b>individual or organization must undergo identity verification</b>. This process can vary depending on the provider, but generally, it involves presenting a government-issued ID and may require a face-to-face meeting or a video call.
The purpose is to thoroughly verify the signatory&#x2019;s identity to tie them securely to their digital signature. For entities or organizations, additional documentation may be required to confirm the authority of the individual requesting the qualified electronic signature on behalf of the organization.</li>
  <li>
    After successful identity verification, the signatory must <b>acquire a secure signature creation device (SSCD)</b>. SSCDs are hardware or software designed to generate and store digital signatures securely. The QTSP often provides guidance on selecting the right SSCD, ensuring it meets eIDAS regulations for security.
  </li>
  <li>
    The final step is the <b>issuance of a digital certificate by the QTSP</b>. This certificate links the signatory&#x2019;s identity with their digital signature, using cryptographic methods for security. The digital certificate is stored on the SSCD, and with it, the signary can now create QESs that are legally binding and recognized across the EU.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Throughout this process, the qualified trust service provider ensures compliance with eIDAS standards, providing qualified electronic signatures that offer the highest level of security and legal recognition for electronic signatures in the European Union.</p><p>While getting a qualified electronic signature demands more effort and rigor compared to simpler forms of electronic signatures, it offers unparalleled assurances for the integrity and authenticity of digital transactions, especially for agreements where legality and security are paramount.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-most-common-uses-of-qes-6-uses-cases-from-banking-to-healthcare">What are the most common uses of QES? 6 uses cases from banking to healthcare</h3><p>Qualified electronic signatures are relevant in a multitude of scenarios, including:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Contract signing and management</b></li>
<p>Businesses frequently use QES for the execution of contracts, agreements, and other legally binding documents. This applies to sectors ranging from real estate, where property sales contracts are sealed, to IT, for software licensing agreements.</p>
<li><b>Government transactions</b></li>
<p>Many government services require secure and authenticated documents. Among other things, qualified electronic signatures are used for submitting tax returns, applying for permits, and other official paperwork, ensuring the integrity and non-repudiation of these transactions.</p>
<li><b>Healthcare records</b></li>
<p>QESs are vital for the confidentiality and accuracy of patient records, treatment consents, and the exchange of medical data between institutions. Not to mention improved efficiency, considering that <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/779180?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> in the US</a>, more than one-third of total expenditures for doctor visits, hospitals, long-term care, and health insurance is eaten away by bureaucracy.</p>
<li><b>Banking and finance</b></li>
<p>For online banking transactions, loan agreements, and insurance policies, qualified electronic signatures provide the necessary level of security and authenticity to protect both the financial institution and the customer. A good example is <a href="https://wise.com/us/blog/sweden-bank-id?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> BankID</a>, Sweden&#x2019;s digital signature validation scheme that&#x2019;s used some 200 times per second.</p>
<li><b>Cross-border transactions</b></li>
<p>Due to its pan-European recognition under the eIDAS regulation, QES facilitates international business dealings and operations, allowing companies to securely transact across member states without the need for physical document exchanges.</p>
<li><b>Intellectual property protection</b></li>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/01/intellectual-property-breaches-a-new-target-for-cybercriminals?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Intangible assets</a> often make up over half of a company&#x2019;s value, and up to 85% for businesses in tech and innovation heavy sectors. Applying qualified electronic signatures in the submission of patents, trademarks, and copyrights ensures the legitimacy and security of these assets.</p>

Headlines about data breaches, privacy violations, and cyberattacks, along with AI job scares and social media manipulations, have got people questioning the impact of technology on our lives from everyday interactions to broader societal issues. Meanwhile, organizations are finding themselves under a brighter spotlight, with both customers and regulators scrutinizing their ethical practices, data protection measures, and how responsibly they handle tech.</p><p>As pretty much every company depends on digital technology in some way for its operations and customer interactions, digital trust is, or at least should be, a universal concern. Especially considering how fragile it is.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  In the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2022 McKinsey Global Survey</a> on Global Trust, nearly half of respondents said they&#x2019;d switch brands if they weren&#x2019;t sure how a company would use their data. In fact, when it came to purchasing decisions, they considered a company&#x2019;s ethics, trustworthiness, and data protection practices almost as important as price and delivery speed. Yet, fewer than a quarter of executives reported that their organizations were actively addressing digital risks across the board, whether it&#x2019;s dealing with AI models, managing data, or fostering diversity in their talent pool.

<p>Put simply, the meaning of digital trust is far-reaching and involves recognizing the broader effects of technology on people, from employees and partners to customers and society as a whole. It&#x2019;s important to stress here that this isn&#x2019;t merely a tech problem but rather a human one. Technology is neither inherently trustworthy or untrustworthy, so digital trust goes beyond trusting the technology itself. Fundamentally, it&#x2019;s about having faith in the individuals and organizations overseeing technology implementation and use.</p><h3 id="why-is-digital-trust-important-explore-5-major-benefits">Why is digital trust important? Explore 5 major benefits</h3><p>Digital trust isn&#x2019;t just some trendy buzzword; it&#x2019;s an imperative for every organization, no matter its size or industry. Here are some reasons why digital trust truly matters:</p><p><strong>1. Protects customer data</strong></p><p>By establishing reliability, credibility and integrity in their tech use, businesses demonstrate their commitment to safeguarding their customers&#x2019; sensitive information. This not only helps in building stronger customer relationships but also ensures compliance with ever-changing data privacy regulations.</p><p><strong>2. Enhances brand reputation</strong></p><p>A data breach or cyber attack can quickly tarnish a business&#x2019;s reputation and turn away potential customers. Conversely, having a strong track record of protecting customer data and maintaining online trust can build confidence in the brand and attract more consumers.</p><p><strong>3. Builds customer loyalty</strong></p><p>Customers are more likely to remain loyal to a business that they trust with their personal information. By providing a secure and transparent digital experience, businesses can foster long-term relationships with their customers, strengthening their confidence in the brand.</p><p><strong>4. Establishes credibility</strong></p><p>Digital trust is a key factor in establishing credibility and reputation for a business. It shows that the company takes their customers&#x2019; privacy seriously and follows ethical practices.</p><p><strong>5. Drives business growth</strong></p><p>When businesses earn their customers&#x2019; trust, they can usually collect more customer data to fuel growth and innovation. This can be used to improve products, tailor marketing, and boost the overall customer experience. Plus, when customers trust a business, they&#x2019;re more likely to spread the word with positive reviews and recommendations.</p><h3 id="the-four-pillars-of-digital-trust-explained">The four pillars of digital trust, explained</h3>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  The technologies fueling digital transformation can both build and erode trust, bring benefits or risks to society. If used responsibly, they have the potential to become powerful allies in boosting transparency, ethics, data privacy, and security &#x2013; what <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/our-thinking/insights/topics/digital-transformation/building-long-term-trust-in-digital-technology.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deloitte calls the four pillars of digital trust.</a>
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>Transparency and accessibility</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  Having clear and easy-to-find information about a company&#x2019;s digital practices is crucial for building trust in its intentions and dedication to providing quality digital products and services. Today&#x2019;s consumers crave transparency, especially when it comes to how their data is handled, including in AI-driven decision-making processes. Research reveals a strong demand for business transparency, with <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/social-media-transparency/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">73% of customers willing to pay more</a> for fully transparent products.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>Ethics and responsibility</strong></p><p>As technology evolves, organizations face ethical challenges that come with increased power. Putting customer needs and societal benefits first can boost credibility and trust levels significantly. This includes promoting fairness, inclusion, and stakeholder welfare while combatting disinformation and applying digital controls to prevent unethical or inappropriate tech use. Embracing strong business ethics is crucial in navigating these challenges.</p><p><strong>Privacy and control</strong></p><p>Customers have long been handing over their data to companies for convenience and personalization, but there&#x2019;s a limit to their consent. Misuse can have serious repercussions &#x2013; think boycotts, public inquiries, and hefty fines under strict regulations like the <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/personal-data-under-the-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>. However, organizations that prioritize consumer privacy and respect customers&#x2019; choices on data collection and management earn more leeway in handling customer information and delivering personalized services.</p><p><strong>Security and reliability</strong></p><p>Consumers value the convenience of digital technologies but expect businesses to take responsibility for the security of their data, including proactively alerting them to suspicious activity in their accounts. With cyber risks on the rise, customers prefer companies that use the latest technology to ensure cyber security in business operations.</p><h3 id="how-to-build-digital-trust-a-non-exhaustive-list-of-practical-steps">How to build digital trust? A non-exhaustive list of practical steps</h3><p><strong>1. Improve transparency</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s important for companies to be upfront about how they handle data and ensure security to build trust in the business. Follow ethical principles when collecting, processing, and storing data, and only use data for disclosed purposes. This means informing customers exactly what data is collected, how it&#x2019;s used, and who it&#x2019;s shared with, in a clear, easy-to-understand way. Make sure to keep customers in the loop about any privacy policy updates and communicate openly in case of a data breach or cyber attack.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: clear privacy policies and terms of service agreements, easily accessible privacy settings and preferences, regular communication with customers through newsletters and/or blog posts, responsiveness</p><p><strong>2. Give customers control</strong></p><p>To build trust in the business, give customers control over their data. This could include opting in or out of data collection, minimizing the amount of information collected to what is necessary, or giving customers the ability to delete their data if they choose. By empowering customers to make decisions about their personal information, you can effectively show commitment to respecting customer privacy.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: easily accessible privacy settings and preferences, data deletion and opt-out options, clear consent forms for data collection, regular data audits, automatic data deletion policies.</p><p><strong>3. Implement strong authentication and </strong><a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/data-access-control/"><strong>access control</strong></a></p><p>An essential part of keeping data safe is making sure that only selected personnel have access to sensitive information. This can be achieved through robust authentication and access control methods. Educate your workforce about <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/change-passwords-create-strong-password/">strong password </a>practices, use multi-factor authentication for all accounts, and limit access to sensitive data only to those who really need it. Keep track of who&#x2019;s got access and update permissions regularly to make sure former employees or unnecessary users don&#x2019;t retain access. Also ensure that access controls are applied fairly and transparently across all user groups.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: strong password requirements, multi-factor authentication systems, role-based access controls, regular password updates</p><p><strong>4. Integrate encryption into your data protection strategy</strong></p><p>Implementing <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/better-safe-than-sorry-which-files-do-you-need-to-encrypt/">strong encryption protocols </a>for all stored and transmitted data is critical for protecting sensitive information against unauthorized access. Encryption acts as a powerful barrier, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable and secure. Prioritize the use of <a href="https://support.tresorit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216114357-Explaining-fundamentals-of-security?ref=tresorit.com">advanced encryption standards </a>and <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/zero-knowledge-encryption/">zero-knowledge</a> <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/why-you-need-cloud-storage-with-end-to-end-encryption/">end-to-end encryption </a>mechanisms to provide maximum protection.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: AES 256-bit encryption, SSL/TLS protocols, end-to-end encryption, VPN for secure remote access</p><p><strong>5. Employ AI and automation for enhanced security</strong></p><p>Implementing AI and automation technologies enhances your organization&#x2019;s ability to secure personal information and maintain customer trust. These tools offer advanced detection capabilities, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities much faster than traditional methods. Plus, they can streamline data classification and encryption, reducing human errors. AI can also assist in monitoring unusual patterns or behaviors that may indicate a security threat, enabling proactive rather than reactive measures.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: AI-powered threat intelligence, automated data classification and encryption, anomaly detection and behavior analytics</p><p><strong>6. Use new technologies responsibly</strong></p><p>Deploying new technologies responsibly is paramount in earning customer confidence and driving positive change. To achieve this, companies must prioritize ethical considerations while leveraging digital innovations to improve their operations. For example, when using AI or automation technologies, make sure they don&#x2019;t perpetuate bias, discrimination, or harm to individuals or specific groups. It&#x2019;s important to regularly monitor and evaluate AI systems to identify any potential ethical or privacy concerns. Employees should also be trained on the responsible use of these technologies, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and intervention when necessary.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: ethical impact assessments, diversity and inclusion training, regular audits and reviews, stakeholder consultations</p><p><strong>7. Educate your workforce and cultivate ethical practices</strong></p><p>Create a culture of ethical reflection and continuous improvement within your organization. Regularly assess your data practices, policies, and technologies to ensure they align with ethical standards and evolving societal expectations. Provide ongoing training and education to your employees on data protection regulations, best practices for handling personal information, and the importance of ethical decision-making. This will help foster a responsible and privacy-aware workforce.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: training courses, <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/simulating-phishing-attacks/">simulated phishing campaigns</a>, employee handbooks, ethics committees or boards, employee surveys</p><p><strong>8. Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations</strong></p><p>Make sure you&#x2019;re familiar with the applicable data protection laws and regulations both in your jurisdiction and field, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU and the <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/california-consumer-privacy-act-a-practical-compliance-checklist/">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> in the U.S., or the <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/hipaa-vs-hitech-understanding-the-difference-and-how-to-comply/">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a> in healthcare. It&#x2019;s crucial for businesses to stay informed about the requirements and take necessary steps to align their practices accordingly to avoid legal consequences and customer backlash.</p><p><strong>Recommended tools and methods</strong>: legal counsel, online resources from regulatory bodies, compliance management software, regular audits</p><h3 id="how-can-digital-trust-promote-business-growth">How can digital trust promote business growth?</h3>

  <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/why-digital-trust-truly-matters?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The 2022 McKinsey Global Survey</a> on Global Trust reveals that being trust-driven can bring significant advantages beyond merely satisfying consumer needs. The survey defines digital-trust leaders as companies where employees follow strict data, AI, and ethics guidelines, and implement best practices for AI, data, and cybersecurity. These organizations outperform their peers in two key areas: loss prevention and earning potential.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Digital-trust leaders showed lower rates of negative AI incidents than others. They experienced a 40% incident rate compared to a rate of 53% at other organizations. They were also less prone to data breaches, with a rate of 49% versus 57% for others.</p><p>Besides, companies leading in trust were 1.6 times more likely than the global average to achieve revenue and EBIT increase rates of 10% or more, a direct result of building confidence in their digital operations. Simply enforcing ethical conduct leads to growth, which a stronger commitment to digital trust through policy integration can only boost further. Adhering to best practices in cybersecurity, data protection, and trustworthy AI enhances this potential even more.</p><p>Other advantages may include:</p><ul><li><strong>Employee satisfaction</strong>: A higher level of digital trust can boost employees&#x2019; trust in the business, particularly their confidence in the company&#x2019;s leadership and decision-making. This leads to a more motivated and loyal workforce, as well as a more positive work environment.</li><li><strong>Improved communication</strong>: Trustworthy tech decisions and ethical considerations can enhance communication within an organization. When employees feel at ease sharing their thoughts, ideas, and concerns without fear of repercussions or judgment, it fosters healthier and more effective communication, collaboration, and teamwork.</li><li><strong>Regulatory compliance and new partnerships</strong>: By proactively focusing on data integrity and security, companies not only avoid fines but also build a reputation for reliability and compliance within their industry. This can attract partnerships and collaborations with other reputable organizations, further strengthening the company&#x2019;s position in the market.</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong>: The commitment to ethical conduct often spurs a culture of creativity and exploration within the company. This can result in pioneering solutions, novel approaches to challenges, and a reputation for being at the forefront of technological advancements.</li><li><strong>Enhanced decision-making</strong>: Leveraging data protection and cybersecurity practices not only improves decision-making processes but also instills a sense of confidence in stakeholders. This trust can lead to stronger partnerships and a more resilient business model overall.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elevate Your Business with Tresorit’s Client Data Rooms: A Complete Solution for Secure Collaboration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Empower your business as a client data room, a secure and centralized platform tailored for collaboration and confidential information sharing. ]]></description><link>https://tresorit.com/blog/elevate-your-business-with-tresorits-client-data-rooms-a-complete-solution-for-secure-collaboration/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66193c59f3322c0001050b2c</guid><category><![CDATA[collaboration]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tresorit Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://tresorit.com/blog/content/images/2024/04/ClientDataRoom_blogcover_withoutlogo@2x.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  Earlier this year, news of a major regulatory proposal by the European Commission stirred up quite a storm in the cybersecurity space. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6168?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Last week</a>, provisional agreement on the so-called Cyber Resilience Act was reached between EU lawmakers, giving way to the passage of the first legislation in the world to regulate digital product safety. 
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The Cyber Resilience Act will lay down requirements for all hardware and software, from baby monitors and smart watches to firewalls and routers, to ensure robust cybersecurity from their conception throughout their entire lifecycle. This &#x201C;cybersecurity by design,&#x201D; EU Commissioner Thierry Breton pointed out, is key to protecting both consumers and society at large.</p><p>But what is cyber resilience, and why is it so important in this day and age? Aren&#x2019;t cyber security and cyber resilience essentially the same thing? And how can businesses, in and outside the EU&#x2019;s digital consumer goods market, boost their cyber resilience and stay protected against ever-evolving threats? Read on to find out.</p><h3 id="what-is-cyber-resilience-meaning-and-key-objectives">What is cyber resilience? Meaning and key objectives</h3>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<h3 id="why-is-cyber-resilience-key-in-today%E2%80%99s-digital-landscape">Why is cyber resilience key in today&#x2019;s digital landscape?</h3><p>Cyber risk resilience lays the foundation for businesses to effectively mitigate and quickly recover from cyber threats and breaches. Cyberattacks can leave businesses with not only significant financial losses, but also damage to reputation and loss of customer trust. By implementing a robust cyber resilience strategy, organizations can ensure the continuity of their operations, even when faced with a severe cyber incident.</p><p>A strong cyber resilience posture can also boost companies&#x2019; regulatory compliance. Many industries have mandatory cybersecurity requirements, such as <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/hipaa-vs-hitech-understanding-the-difference-and-how-to-comply/" rel="noreferrer">HIPAA</a>&#xA0; for healthcare and <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-is-your-business-ready-for-pci-dss-4-0/">PCI DSS </a>for the financial services sector, and falling short can result in hefty fines or sanctions. With sensitive data being a high-value currency in the knowledge economy, a breach can have devastating consequences for individuals and businesses alike.</p><h3 id="the-most-concerning-cyber-risks-businesses-face-explained">The most concerning cyber risks businesses face, explained</h3>

At the same time, the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million &#x2013; that&#x2019;s according to IBM&#x2019;s annual <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>. Let&#x2019;s see the most common types of attacks that add to companies&#x2019; growing cyber stress. 
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>1. Phishing attacks</strong></p><p><a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/phishing-vs-spear-phishing-explained/">Phishing&#xA0; attacks</a> involve cybercriminals impersonating a legitimate entity to trick users into revealing sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification numbers. Phishing is often executed through deceptive emails, text messages, or fake websites, and it poses a significant threat to organizations of all sizes.</p><p><strong>2. Ransomware attacks</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  In a ransomware attack, hackers infiltrate a network, encrypt company data, and then demand a ransom to restore access. Attacks of this kind can cripple business operations and result in major financial losses, especially if the organization isn&#x2019;t prepared to restore from a backup. Ransom payouts totaled $449.1 million in the first 6 months of 2023 alone, per <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ransomware-attacks-rise-2023/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wired.</a>
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>3. Insider threats</strong></p><p><a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/top-insider-threats-indicators/" rel="noreferrer">Insider threats</a>&#xA0; refer to cyber threats originating from within the organization, either from disgruntled employees, former staff, or careless team members. These threats can involve data breaches, data theft, or the introduction of malware into the company&#x2019;s systems, and they often fly under the radar until substantial damage has been done.</p><p><strong>4. Advanced persistent threats</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats-and-nation-state-actors?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Advanced persistent threats</a>, or APTs for short, are long-term, targeted attacks, where cybercriminals, usually of the well-resourced and sophisticated variety, gain access to an organization&#x2019;s network and remain undetected for an extended period. The goal is typically to steal, spy, disrupt, or destruct and is often achieved using multiple attack vectors.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>5. Distributed denial-of-service attacks</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks render an organization&#x2019;s online services unreachable or inaccessible by overwhelming them with a flood of internet traffic. A DoS attack becomes a <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/what-is-a-ddos-attack-and-how-to-prevent-it/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">distributed denial-of-service  (DDoS) attack</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/understanding-and-responding-to-ddos-attacks_508c.pdf?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CISA</a> explains, &#x201C;when the overloading traffic originates from more than one attacking machine operating in concert.&#x201D;
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>6. Zero-day exploits</strong>&#xA0;</p><p>Zero-day exploits take advantage of software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software&#x2019;s developer. These vulnerabilities are exploited before the developer has had a chance to create and distribute a fix, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to defend against. LinkedIn was famously hit by such an attack in 2019, affecting 90% of its user base.</p><p><strong>8. Supply chain attacks</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
   In a supply chain attack, a cybercriminal targets a less secure element in an organization&#x2019;s supply chain to gain access to its network. These attacks are notoriously hard to fend off due to the broad and interconnected nature of most supply chains. In fact, <a href="https://connect.comptia.org/blog/cyber-security-stats-facts?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research shows</a> that up to 40% of cyber threats are now occurring directly through the supply chain.

<h3 id="cybersecurity-vs-cyber-resilience-key-differences-and-why-they-matter">Cybersecurity vs. cyber resilience: key differences and why they matter&#xA0;</h3><p>Cybersecurity and cyber resilience, while interconnected, represent two distinct aspects of organizations&#x2019; overall <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/cyber-risks-a-comprehensive-guide-and-strategies-for-resilience/" rel="noreferrer">cyber risk</a>&#xA0; management strategy.</p><p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from attacks in the digital space. It is typically preventive in nature, focusing on setting up defenses to keep intruders out. Traditional cybersecurity measures often include firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection methods. The primary goal of cybersecurity is to minimize the risk of a cyberattack and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p><p>Cyber attack resiliency, however, describes an organization&#x2019;s ability to continue operating despite a cyberattack or any other security incident.</p><p>Rather than honing in on prevention, cyber resilience incorporates elements of response and recovery. It acknowledges that not all threats can be completely eliminated and emphasizes the importance of having systems in place to limit the damage, recover operations, and ensure business continuity when an incident does occur. Cyber resilience may include disaster recovery planning, business continuity plans, and incident response teams.</p><h3 id="building-an-effective-cyber-resilience-strategy-main-components-and-considerations">Building an effective cyber resilience strategy: main components and considerations</h3><p>Effective cyber resilience starts with accepting the reality of today&#x2019;s cyber environment, which is that security breaches are not just possible, but highly probable. A strong cyber resilience strategy can aid an organization in efficiently bouncing back and recovering from such incidents, drawing on multiple tools and approaches.</p><p>The first is risk assessment. This involves identifying potential vulnerabilities within an organization&#x2019;s systems and processes that could be targeted by cyber threats. Rather than a one-and-done affair, risk assessment should be an ongoing evaluation of threats as new vulnerabilities emerge and attack methods evolve.</p><p>Second is incident response planning. This involves developing a detailed plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a cyberattack. It should include the initial response to detect and limit the impact of the incident, communication processes to inform stakeholders, and procedures to investigate the breach and identify its cause.</p><p>Third, business continuity and disaster recovery planning are essential. The former will ensure that critical operations can continue in the face of adverse cyber events. In comparison, disaster recovery plans focus on restoring systems and data after an incident using data backups, redundant systems, and data restoration procedures.</p><p>Lastly, effective cyber resilience involves regular testing and reviews to ensure that plans remain effective as the organization and its threat environment change. This could involve simulated attacks to test responses, regular audits of systems, controls, and processes, and updates to cyber resilience plans based on the results of such assessments.</p><h3 id="how-to-strengthen-cyber-resilience-best-practices-and-solutions">How to strengthen cyber resilience? Best practices and solutions</h3><p><strong>1. Routine security audits</strong></p><p>Regularly scheduled audits are crucial to uncovering potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. They provide an overview of the existing security architecture, helping to find any weak points and make necessary improvements.</p><p><strong>2. Regular system updates</strong></p><p>Organizations must commit to regular updates of all software, hardware, and operating systems to stay protected against the latest known threats. Delaying updates can lay systems bare to potential cyber attacks and breaches.</p><p><strong>3. Data backup</strong></p><p>Regular data backups are paramount to building a cyber resilient business. They should be automated and stored off-site or on a secure cloud platform. In the event of a breach, backups can minimize data loss and help restore mission-critical functions more quickly.</p><p><strong>4. Secure password practices</strong></p><p>Implement secure password policies, including the use of complex passwords, frequent changes, and multi-factor authentication, one of the most effective methods of protection against password compromise and unauthorized access to enterprise systems.</p><p><strong>5. Threat intelligences</strong></p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
  <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/security-threat-intelligence-services?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Use threat intelligence services</a> to stay in the know about the latest attack vectors. Such services provide real-time updates about potential threats, indicators of compromise, threat actor attribution and campaigns, allowing businesses to preemptively protect their systems.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><strong>6. Employee training</strong></p><p>Employees can be a weak link in cybersecurity, so ensuring they are aware of potential risks and understand the role they play in maintaining cyber resilience is key. Training should be regularly updated to keep pace with evolving threats, such as social engineering attacks.</p><p><strong>7. End-to-end encryption</strong></p><p>Protect sensitive data with encryption, both at rest and in transit. Even better, <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/why-you-need-cloud-storage-with-end-to-end-encryption/">end-to-end encryption</a>, which encodes messages before they&#x2019;re sent and decodes them only after arriving at a recipient&#x2019;s device. This means that no one in the middle can read or modify them.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Compliance by design: Introducing EU qualified electronic signatures]]></title><description><![CDATA[Streamline document management with Tresorit eSign.

We&#x2019;re committed to taking business digital</h3><p>It might be 2023, but some office tasks remain stubbornly synonymous with old-fashioned paper and ink. At Tresorit, we&#x2019;re focusing on widening the range of tasks that can be carried out completely within our encrypted, cloud-based workspace, so that offices can truly embrace paperless working.</p><p>The introduction of <a href="https://tresorit.com/esign?ref=tresorit.com">Tresorit eSign </a>in 2022 &#x2014; allowing users to send and sign documents from within the Tresorit workspace &#x2014; was our latest step in creating a digital management system that cares for your documents throughout their entire lifecycle.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll be building on all of these features, as well as working to integrate our secure platform with IoT systems &#x2014; bringing the peace of mind that comes with cutting-edge cybersecurity to every area of your workplace.</p><h3 id="2-tresorit%E2%80%99s-most-secure-electronic-signature-is-heading-to-the-eu">2.

<p>For the average internet user, tracing emails can still be quite daunting. But when dealing with potential online scams or cyberbullying, knowing where an email originated from becomes crucial. In this article, we&#x2019;ll explore how email tracing works, what you can do with the information it provides, and how you can avoid being traced yourself.</p><h3 id="when-to-trace-an-email-address-7-warning-signs-to-look-out-for">When to trace an email address: 7 warning signs to look out for</h3><p>First things first, what is email tracing? Simply put, it&#x2019;s the process of tracking an email&#x2019;s path from its point of origin, that is, the sender&#x2019;s device or server, to its final destination, the recipient&#x2019;s inbox. This journey involves passing through multiple servers and networks, leaving behind digital footprints that can give us clues to the sender&#x2019;s location and device.</p><p>Here are seven red flags that may warrant tracing an email address:</p><ol><li><strong>Unknown senders</strong>: If you receive an email from an unfamiliar sender, especially one that asks for sensitive information or money, it&#x2019;s crucial to verify its authenticity to avoid falling prey to a scam.</li><li><strong>Suspicious links</strong>: Often containing unusual characters, misspelled words, or unfamiliar domains, they may lead to malicious websites or trigger malware downloads. Before clicking, be sure to hover over any fishy-looking link to view the full URL.</li><li><strong>Suspicious attachments</strong>:<strong> </strong>Any email with an unexpected attachment should set off alarm bells. These could contain malware that can infect your device and/or compromise your data.</li><li><strong>Misspelled domains</strong>: Scammers often use a similar, but misspelled version of a genuine company domain to trick users. Always double-check the domain of any email that seems even slightly off.</li><li><strong>Urgency or threat</strong>: This is one of scammers&#x2019; favorite tactics to manipulate recipients into hasty actions. If an email contains urgency or threats, like closing an account, paying a fine, or winning a time-sensitive prize, it could well be a <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/de/der-unterschied-zwischen-phishing-und-spear-phishing/">phishing attempt</a>.</li><li><strong>Unusual information requests</strong>: Legitimate organizations won&#x2019;t normally ask for sensitive information (like passwords, social security numbers, or bank account numbers) over email. That&#x2019;s a red flag if we&#x2019;ve ever seen one.</li><li><strong>Inconsistent language or bad grammar:</strong> Emails from reputable organizations are generally well-written. If you spot grammar or spelling errors, or if the language style seems inconsistent or unnatural, it may be a scam.</li></ol>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>Of course, there are other reasons to trace an email. Often it is to find the culprits behind cyberbullying or harassment. If you&#x2019;ve been subject to threatening or harassing messages via email, tracing the sender can provide valuable information for reporting them to the authorities or blocking them from contacting you again. Sadly, the issue is more common than you might think and is not limited to teenagers: in both 2017 and 2021, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">41% of Americans reported having had personal experience of online harassment</a>. And to make matters worse, it seems that the severity of online harassment actually increased over time.
</p>
<p>
Email tracing can also prove invaluable for businesses dealing with potential threats or security breaches. It may help companies identify the source of a malicious email and take the necessary steps to safeguard their systems. These might include blocking the sender&#x2019;s IP address, enhancing security measures, or alerting law enforcement agencies. Deloitte reported that a whopping <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/my/en/pages/risk/articles/91-percent-of-all-cyber-attacks-begin-with-a-phishing-email-to-an-unexpected-victim.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">91% of cyber attacks start with a phishing email</a>, highlighting the importance of being able to spot and trace malicious emails.

<h3 id="how-to-trace-an-email-address-a-quick-guide">How to trace an email address: a quick guide</h3>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
The first step in tracing an email is to look at the full <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/email-header?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">email header</a>. This snippet of code is created by the client mail program that first sends the email, with additional text being added by each mail server the email goes through. It includes information such as the sender&#x2019;s and recipient&#x2019;s email addresses, subject line, content type, the path of the email, time stamp, and identification data.
</p>
<p>
The location of the email header varies based on the email provider you&#x2019;re using. In most cases, it&#x2019;s under the &#x201C;three-dot&#x201D; or &#x201C;more&#x201D; menu when you open the email in question. You can find detailed online instructions on how to view the email header in popular email clients like <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436?hl=en&amp;ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/view-all-email-headers-mmcc887ce9/icloud?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Mail</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/view-all-email-headers-mmcc887ce9/icloud?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Outlook</a>, and <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN28478.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Mail</a>.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Once you have the header open, look for the line that starts with &#x201C;Received: from&#x201D;. This will show you a chronological list of all the servers the message has traveled through before reaching your inbox. It&#x2019;s like tracking a parcel online as it moves from one shipping facility to another. By examining the information in this section, you can get clues about the sender&#x2019;s location.</p><p>You could also use online email tracing tools or software to further analyze the header and trace the email&#x2019;s origin. These tools can help you determine the approximate location of the sender, as well as any potential email forwarding or redirection.</p><h3 id="is-it-possible-to-track-the-ip-address-of-the-email-sender">Is it possible to track the IP address of the email sender?</h3>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
Yes, but it&#x2019;s not always easy. Some email providers display the sender&#x2019;s IP (short for <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/IP-address-Internet-Protocol-Address?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Internet Protocol</a>) address, aka a unique numerical identifier for each device connected to the internet, in the &#x201C;Received&#x201D; section of the email header mentioned above. One of the exceptions is Gmail&#x2019;s web interface, where the IP address you see in the header doesn&#x2019;t belong to the sender, it&#x2019;s the IP address of the Gmail server. 
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>So, what can you do with an IP address? There are handy online tools that can help you track an IP address from an email geographically. Free or paid, they may give you an idea of the sender&#x2019;s approximate location, like the country and city.</p><h3 id="does-this-mean-that-you-can-trace-an-email-to-a-location">Does this mean that you can trace an email to a location?</h3><p>Sometimes, and with limitations. Tracking an email to a specific location, let alone to a home address, is a complex task, which is virtually impossible for a layperson to accomplish. While you might be able to gather some information about the source of an email, such as the IP address or the server it was sent from, determining the physical location of the sender is a whole different ball game.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
Emails are routed through various servers and networks, making it challenging to pinpoint an email user&#x2019;s exact location. What&#x2019;s more, the information in the header may not be accurate or reliable &#x2013; it might even be forged so it looks like the message is coming from someone else. To further complicate the tracing process, the sender can hide their IP address using a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/virtual_private_network?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a>, a proxy server or other methods.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Tracing anonymous emails also requires technical knowledge and an understanding of email protocols, making it a tricky task even for more experienced investigators.</p><h3 id="ok-but-can-you-at-least-trace-an-email-address-to-its-owner">OK, but can you at least trace an email address to its owner?</h3><p>It&#x2019;s possible, but usually requires more advanced techniques and legal authorizations. In most cases, tracing an email address to its owner involves working with internet service providers (ISPs) and obtaining a court order or subpoena for the necessary information.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the sender hasn&#x2019;t taken measures to conceal their identity, you might be able to tie an email back to a person through some online detective work. For example, you could look up the email address on social media platforms or use professional networking sites to see if it&#x2019;s linked to a particular individual. There are also reverse email lookup tools available that can search for any public records associated with a given email address.</p><h3 id="can-emails-be-traced-by-the-police">Can emails be traced by the police?</h3><p>Law enforcement and government agencies typically have the right to request information from email service providers and internet service providers, including IP addresses, metadata and user data, which can help in tracing the origin of an email. While laws and regulations may differ across countries, the majority of them require a search warrant, court order or subpoena for such information to be released.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
If you check the privacy policy of your email service, you&#x2019;ll probably find that they reserve the right to share user information in response to legal requests. For example, Google complied with government requests from around the world nearly 80% of the time in 2022 according to its latest <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en&amp;user_requests_report_period=series%3Arequests%2Caccounts%3Bauthority%3AUS%3Btime%3A&amp;lu=user_requests_report_period&amp;ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Transparency Report</a>.
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>OK, but anyone can create a fake email address using a made-up name and personal details. Which begs the question: can a fake email be traced by the police? Yes, especially if the sender uses a regular email service. IP addresses, browser information, and other metadata can still be obtained from the email provider, which can help law enforcement identify the person behind the email.</p><p>The police might also be able to trace anonymous emails, but this largely depends on the sender&#x2019;s methods to cover their tracks. If they use a VPN and opt for a disposable email service that doesn&#x2019;t require any personal information to create an account, it can be difficult for the authorities to track them down.</p><h3 id="is-my-email-address-being-tracked">Is my email address being tracked?</h3><p>Now, let&#x2019;s talk about the flip side of the story: being tracked.</p><p>Email tracking, commonly used in marketing and sales, involves monitoring interactions with emails sent to potential or existing customers. The data collected in the process provides valuable insights into customer behavior and the effectiveness of various email campaigns. In other words, it allows informed business decisions to be made. But how does it work?</p><p>The tracking software inserts a tiny, transparent image called a pixel to track open rates and gather information about the recipient&#x2019;s interaction with the email. For example, when the email is opened, the pixel is loaded and transmits a signal back to the tracking software, providing real-time data on recipient activity. This can range from basic information like whether the email was opened or not, to more advanced metrics such as how many times it was opened, where it was opened from, and which links were clicked.</p><p>Most email service providers also gather data on user behavior, including which emails they open, how long they spend reading them, and which links they click on &#x2013; and a whole lot more. This data is used to create detailed profiles of users, which can be invaluable for targeted marketing and sales efforts. Actually, you might be surprised by how much, for example, Google&#x2019;s email service knows about you, from your interests and location to the stuff you buy.</p><p>As explained earlier, your email address can also be traced back to you, especially if you&#x2019;re not using a VPN or similar tool to protect your online identity. So, if you want to avoid your email activity being tracked, it&#x2019;s important to take the necessary precautions.</p><h3 id="ways-to-prevent-your-emails-from-being-tracked">Ways to prevent your emails from being tracked</h3><p>First, it&#x2019;s a good idea to regularly check and update your privacy settings on all of your email accounts. Google, for example, allows users to customize their ad settings and control how their data is used for personalized advertising. You can also disable the automatic display of external images feature in your email settings, as this is often used by trackers to collect data about when and where an email is opened.</p><p>You might also want to consider using a VPN, as it can add an extra layer of security and privacy to your online activities. It can help prevent your IP address from being tracked and linked to your email activity.</p><p>Another way to enhance email privacy is to use an encrypted email service, such as <a href="https://tresorit.com/email-encryption-service?ref=tresorit.com">Tresorit&#x2019;s end-to-end encrypted email</a>. This ensures that only the sender and recipient can access the content of the email, and no data is stored on the email provider&#x2019;s servers.</p><p>For more details on how to send documents securely via email, read our guide on email safety&#xA0; and learn how to secure emails in Outlook with just one click.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unveiling Security Vulnerabilities: Why secure enough is NOT an option]]></title><description><![CDATA[Get actionable insights to fortify your organization's defense mechanisms.]]></description><link>https://tresorit.com/blog/unveiling-security-vulnerabilities-why-secure-enough-is-not-an-option/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">65c5ff67a69f970001b8d266</guid><category><![CDATA[end-to-end encryption]]></category><category><![CDATA[compliance]]></category><category><![CDATA[GDPR]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Tresorit Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 08:00:17 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://tresorit.com/blog/content/images/2024/02/SecureEnough_blogcover_withoutlogo@2x.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://tresorit.com/blog/content/images/2024/02/SecureEnough_blogcover_withoutlogo@2x.png" alt="Unveiling Security Vulnerabilities: Why secure enough is NOT an option"><p></p><h3 id="common-pitfalls-behind-the-notion-of-secure-enough"><strong>Common pitfalls behind the notion of &quot;secure enough&quot;</strong></h3><p>In an age characterized by digital advancements and interconnected business landscapes, the significance of information security cannot be overstated.

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>Therefore, the notion of <i>&quot;secure enough&quot;</i> is no longer an acceptable stance when it comes to cloud solutions safeguarding crucial business data.

Do you also lock it? Do you leave the key under the doormat?</p><p>In the offline world, businesses employ a range of security measures to safeguard their office buildings and assets kept inside. Access control systems, such as key cards or biometric scans, are commonly implemented to regulate entry and restrict unauthorized personnel. Surveillance cameras strategically placed throughout the premises serve as both a deterrent and a means of monitoring activities. Intrusion detection systems and alarms add an additional layer of protection by alerting security personnel to any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. Many businesses also invest in security personnel or private security services to maintain a visible presence and respond promptly to potential threats.</p><p>In a similar vein, businesses should also aim to create a comprehensive security framework when it comes to their assets online.</p>

Last year, the personal information of <a href="https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/review-into-psni-data-breach?ref=tresorit.com#:~:text=On%208%20August%202023%2C%20the,a%20Freedom%20of%20Information%20request." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9,483 police officers and staff</a> working at the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) was leaked following a Freedom of Information request. The error happened as a junior member of staff sent out an unencrypted excel document containing surnames and initials, rank, location, and department of all current PSNI officers. The incident shed light to outdated information management practices and that storing sensitive information in a mainstream software &#x2013; in this case the excel sheet &#x2013; is simply not secure enough.&#xA0;
</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The implementation of proper access management could have prevented this leak. Through access management, information can be limited, requiring junior staff members to seek permission for access. Storing this highly sensitive data in an encrypted format would have been paramount, too.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/human-error-drives-most-cyber-incidents-could-ai-help?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">human error is still the number one cause</a> of data incidents. During red team engagements, which aim to test a company&#x2019;s security system, vulnerabilities related to human behavior, such as weak passwords, social engineering susceptibility, and inadequate training are also often uncovered. Addressing these factors is critical to creating a resilient security framework.

<img src="https://tresorit.com/blog/content/images/2024/03/StrongPasswords_blogcover_withoutlogo@2x.png" alt="Creating strong passwords: your 2024 guide on how to set up passwords that will keep you safe"><p>In what&#x2019;s now a year-end tradition, <a href="https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">NordPass</a> has recently published its list of the 200 most used passwords. As always, there&#x2019;s good news and there&#x2019;s bad news. The good news is that last year&#x2019;s top choice, &#x201C;password,&#x201D; has been dethroned and now &#x201C;only&#x201D; holds seventh place. The bad news is&#x2026; pretty much everything else.</p>

<p>For the fourth time since the study was first released in 2019, &#x201C;123456&#x201D; came out as the most popular password worldwide, followed by &#x201C;admin,&#x201D; &#x201C;12345678,&#x201D; and &#x201C;123456789.&#x201D; On a lighter note, a round of applause is also due to the nearly 1,400 UK users whose idea of creating strong passwords was to show off their team pride, opting for some true headscratchers like &#x201C;liverpool,&#x201D; &#x201C;arsenal,&#x201D; and &#x201C;chelsea.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Why is this glaring lack of hard-to-crack passwords such a problem? How to create strong passwords that are both memorable and can stand up to a potential cyberattack? What are the most common mistakes people make when trying to come up with a difficult password? This is what we&#x2019;ll look into this week, as well as key tips and tools for strong password creation with examples.</p>

<p>Phishing, data leakage, and more: top IT security risks posed by poor password hygiene</p>
<p>In an era of rapid digital transformation, strong passwords often serve as the first line of defense against cybersecurity threats. They&#x2019;re also a hot commodity among cybercriminals, with 18% of the most common items for sale on the dark web including online accounts, emails, and passwords, <a href="https://nordvpn.com/research-lab/dark-web-case-study/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NordVPN</a> concluded based on 22,000 listings. In fact, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/incident-classification-patterns-intro/web-application-attacks/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verizon</a> says, 86% of all web app attacks use stolen credentials for initial access.</p>

<p>One of the key reasons behind this trend might be that sophisticated hacking techniques are becoming more commonplace. Hackers increasingly have access to algorithms that can crack simple passwords in a matter of seconds. Complex passwords containing a minimum of 12 characters, however, can significantly slow down or even deter these hacking attempts.</p>

<p>A 2023 <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-an-8-character-password-could-be-cracked-in-less-than-an-hour/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> found that an 8-character password, even if it&#x2019;s complex, could be figured out in just five minutes using the latest graphics processing and AI technology. An 18-character password consisting of nothing but numbers would require six days to crack. A password of the same length and with only lowercase letters in it would take 481,000 years to work out.</p>

<p>Also, let&#x2019;s not forget that businesses often hold not just their own sensitive data, but also that of their customers. If a breach occurs, the company&#x2019;s profitability and reputation might not be the only thing put on the line &#x2013; so can be the personal and financial security of countless individuals. Add the hefty fines of non-compliance with data protection laws to the mix, and it&#x2019;s easy to see how far-reaching the consequences of one poorly chosen password can be.</p>

<h3>What makes a password strong? Definition and key characteristics</h3>

<p>In essence, a secure password is a unique string of characters that&#x2019;s hard to guess. It should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. However, it shouldn&#x2019;t contain obvious personal information or common words.</p>

<p>How to make a good password that passes security checks? Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it&#x2019;s at least 12 characters long, but the longer the better (see above);</li>
  <li>it combines lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters;</li>
  <li>it doesn&#x2019;t contain any personal information, such as name or date of birth;</li>
  <li>it&#x2019;s not used to log in to any of your other personal or work accounts; and</li>
  <li>it doesn&#x2019;t include common keyboard paths, such as &#x201C;qwerty&#x201D; or &#x201C;asdfgh.&#x201D;</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to create a secure password? Tips and best practices with examples</h3>

<p>Need inspiration to create a password that&#x2019;s easy to remember but near-impossible to crack? Follow our step-by-step guide on how to choose a strong password.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Length matters</b> - Start with a minimum of 12 characters. The longer your password, the harder it is for a hacker to crack it. Better yet, instead of using a password like &#x201C;BowWow&#x201D;, consider a lengthier passphrase such as &#x201C;BowWowLovesBones&#x201D;.</li>
  <li><b>Mix it up</b> - Use a variety of characters &#x2013; uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to make your password even more secure. For example, you can change the above string to &#x201C;BowWowLovesBone$2020&#x201D;.</li>
  <li><b>Avoid obvious choices</b> - Never use personally identifiable information, such as your name, birthday, or pet name. Cybercriminals can often find these details online and use it to work out your password. Be creative and choose something unexpected.</li>
  <li><b>Steer clear of common words</b> - Stay clear of dictionary words, as there are programs that can quickly run through common words and phrases. For example, you can replace &#x201C;loves&#x201D; with a less used synonym and choose &#x201C;BowWowAdore$Bone$2020.&#x201D;</li>
  <li><b>Include shortcut codes and acronyms</b> - Use shortcut codes and acronyms related to a phrase or sentence that you can easily remember. For example, you can transform &#x201C;BowWowAdore$Bone$2020&#x201D; into something along the lines of &#x201C;BWA$B$2()2().&#x201D;</li>
  <li><b>Pull up a password generator</b> - Still no luck? LastPass, Avast, NordPass, and several other password managers offer freely available online tools for generating passwords of varying length, makeup, and complexity, including easy-to-say and easy-to-read options.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Mistakes you don&#x2019;t want to make when creating a strong password &#x2013; with examples</h3>

<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve covered some of the best ways to create a password, let&#x2019;s have a look at some of the worst ones.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Reusing passwords</b> - Reusing the same password across multiple platforms is a rookie mistake. And can be a costly one at that: according to <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/resources/reports/password-benchmark-report?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LastPass</a>, employees reuse passwords an average of 13 times, leaving all associated accounts, work or private, vulnerable if one is compromised.</li>
  <li><b>Keeping passwords short</b> - People often choose shorter passwords because they&#x2019;re easier to remember. That might be true, but they&#x2019;re also more susceptible to brute-force attacks. Aim for a password length of at least 12 characters. For your most important accounts, like online banking, go for 14 or 16.</li>
  <li><b>Using personal information</b> - Never use personally identifiable information such as the name of your spouse, kids &#x2013; or your favorite soccer team &#x2013; as passwords. This information can be easily figured out by hackers (or anyone with access to social media, for that matter), making your accounts an easy target.</li>
  <li><b>Missing out on two-factor authentication</b> - Two-factor authentication requires users to provide two distinct forms of identification to access a website or application, which many see as an unnecessary hassle. However, this extra layer of security can significantly decrease the possibility of <a href="https://tresorit.com/blog/de/die-kompromittierung-von-passwortern-warum-sie-passiert-und-wie-sie-sie-verhindern-konnen/" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">password compromise.</a></li>
  <li><b>Not changing passwords regularly</b> - Having the same password for years is risky. Regularly updating your passwords not only makes it more difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to your accounts, but it also limits the amount of time they can spend in it, along with the amount of damage they can cause.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Strong, unique passwords: why they&#x2019;re a business imperative in the digital age</h3>

<p>Due to the potential risks and consequences associated with security breaches, no company can afford to ignore the importance of securing passwords. Weak or compromised credentials can serve as an easy entry point for cybercriminals, giving them access to sensitive company data from financial information through customer records to trade secrets. The theft or misuse of such data can result in significant financial loss and reputational damage.</p>

<p>With ever-tightening regulations around data protection, a breach could also lead to hefty fines and legal consequences. For example, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/pdf/cppa_act.pdf?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">penalties</a> of up to $7,500 per intentional violation might be imposed. On top of that, if a data breach leads to consumers exercising the private right of action granted under the CCPA, they might be awarded $100-$750 statutory damages or actual damages, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>Not to mention the potential havoc a data breach can wreak on companies&#x2019; business operations. A cyberattack can cause prolonged system downtime and service unavailability, halting critical activities and resulting in a loss of productivity and revenue. Cleaning up after a security incident also diverts resources away from core business operations, which can negatively impact a company&#x2019;s growth and market competitiveness for years to come.</p>

<p>Finally, securing passwords is essential for maintaining trust with customers and business partners. After all, if a company can&#x2019;t keep its own data safe, why would any of their stakeholders have faith in its ability to protect theirs? Such a loss of trust can have lingering effects long after operations are restored. In the finance, retail and healthcare space, for example, up to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/companies-need-to-take-responsibility-for-protecting/242355?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a third of consumers</a> will stop doing business with a company after a breach.</p>

<h3>How Tresorit keeps your data &#x2013; and passwords &#x2013; safe and reduces the risk of compromise</h3>

<p>An end-to-end encrypted document productivity and digital trust platform, Tresorit uses <a href="https://tresorit.com/features/zero-knowledge-encryption?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">zero-knowledge</a> protocol to encrypt and keep your data safe. Zero-knowledge encryption is a method that makes it impossible even for your service provider to know anything about your encryption key or the data you&#x2019;re processing or storing on its servers. Everything you have or do there, including your password, gets encrypted before it reaches our servers without the encryption key ever being revealed to us. Even better, your data is protected by zero-knowledge encryption no matter where you decide to access it.</p>

<p>Tresorit also allows users to turn on <a href="https://support.tresorit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216114527-Set-up-two-step-verification-recommended?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) as an added layer of security to their accounts and systems. By requiring a secondary method of verification, 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are stolen or hacked. To enable the feature, head to your Profile page using Web Access, then go to security. Click &#x201C;Enable&#x201D; and follow the instructions. Once two-factor authentication is activated, every time you sign in, you will be asked to enter a randomly generated verification code sent to you via text, email, phone call, or a verification app.</p>

<img src="https://tresorit.com/blog/content/images/2024/02/HIPAA-compliant_emails_blogcover_withoutlogo@2x.png" alt="The what, why, how and how not-to of sending HIPAA-compliant emails, explained"><p>According to IBM&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, business email compromises rank among the four costliest incident types with an average cost of $4.67 million. This includes the expenses the survey respondents have incurred as a result of detection and escalation, notification, post-breach response, and lost business, such as forensic expert fees, discounts for future products and services, or the cost of outsourcing hotline support.</p>

<p>For HIPAA-covered entities, however, the same figure can sneak much, much higher, depending on whether they&#x2019;ve failed to ensure HIPAA compliance for email. As in 100-50,000-dollars-per-violation higher. In this article, we&#x2019;ll take a closer look at all things email HIPAA compliance, from what HIPAA compliance means for email to what HIPAA compliant email services are available to covered entities.</p>

<h3>First things first: what is HIPAA-compliant email? </h3>

<p>A quick recap from our previous deep dives on HIPAA administrative safeguards and HIPAA technical safeguards: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/features/HIPAA?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">signed into law</a> in 1996 with the primary aim of helping more Americans get health insurance coverage, preventing employees from losing their health insurance between jobs, and minimizing waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>To address the privacy risks new technology advancements had brought to the healthcare space, legislators adopted the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HIPAA Privacy Rule</a> in December 2000 and the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HIPAA Security Rule</a> in February 2003. More specifically, the purpose of these new rules was to set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information, respectively.</p>

<p>Protected health information, or PHI, refers to <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/considered-phi-hipaa/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">any information</a> created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to an individual&#x2019;s past, present, or future physical or mental health condition, or the provision or payment of health care to an individual.</p>

<p>Under the Security Rule of HIPAA, ePHI (short for electronic protected health information) roughly translates to &#x201C;protected health information in electronic form.&#x201D; This refers to protected health information that is created, transferred, received, stored and managed by a covered entity through electronic means. The same rule prescribes that reasonably anticipated threats to the security of ePHI must be identified and protected against.</p>

<p>Is email a HIPAA compliant way of transmitting and keeping PHI secure? It can be, if emailing PHI happens with proper cybersecurity measures in place, such as encryption, masking, or scrambling. This is crucial because human error, stemming from either unintentional or lack of action on an employee&#x2019;s part, can be just as great a liability for healthcare providers&#x2019; email HIPAA compliance efforts as malicious outsiders. Let&#x2019;s see how.</p>

<h3>HIPAA violation examples: email and social media edition</h3>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<b>The employee who was way too eager to Yelp</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to reviews on Yelp, one of the biggest crowd-sourced review sites with more than 178 million visitors per month, is a great way to build visibility and trust with customers. Until it becomes a violation of PHI privacy requirements under HIPAA. In 2019, Texas-based dental practice Elite Dental Associates learned this the hard way.</li>

<li>When replying to a patient&#x2019;s post, Elite disclosed their last name as well as details of their health condition, treatment plan, insurance, and cost information, <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/dental-practice-fined-10000-for-phi-disclosures-on-yelp/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HIPAA Journal reported</a>. An investigation by the US Department of Health and Human Services&#x2019; Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ensued, which not only confirmed impermissible PHI disclosure on the healthcare provider&#x2019;s part in this particular case but in several others.</li>

<li>To make things worse, the inquiry also discovered that Elite had failed to implement PHI-related policies and procedures and include the minimum required content in its Notice of Privacy Practices as per the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In the end, the OCR imposed a fine of $10,000 and a corrective action plan for Elite, including the development of HIPAA-compliant policies, to resolve past violations and prevent future ones.</li>
</ul>
  <p></p>

<p>
<b>The rushed comment about a deceased co-worker on YouTube</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, a New York City emergency room nurse came under scrutiny after sharing video footage of her and her colleagues speaking about the hardships they had to overcome while working as frontline staff at the height of the coronavirus crisis. Unfortunately, while describing how they could have saved more lives had they not faced shortages of protective equipment and supplies, they named a former colleague who died from COVID-19 at Lincoln Hospital.</li>

<li>The results of the investigation that followed have not been publicly released, but discipline and temporary suspension were listed as potential outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>The ill-considered mass email campaign to bariatric patients</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In an example cited by Allan Collautt Associates, a health center based in Springfield, Pennsylvania, sent an email to approximately 900 bariatric surgery patients informing them of a support group. Because the recipients&#x2019; addresses were entered in the email&#x2019;s CC field, they were visible to everyone who received it. Since everyone who read the email could have reasonably assumed that all recipients had received bariatric surgery, a misstep like this might be grounds for a HIPAA violation.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="whose-email-communication-do-hipaa-requirements-apply-to">Whose email communication do HIPAA requirements apply to?</h3><p>Email communication initiated by a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html?ref=tresorit.com">HIPAA-covered entity</a>, meaning:</p><ul><li>health plans, including health insurance companies, HMOs, company health plans, government programs that pay for healthcare, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the military and veterans health care programs;</li><li>doctors, clinics, psychologists, dentists, chiropractors, nursing homes, and pharmacies, provided they transmit any information electronically in connection with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard;</li><li>health care clearinghouses, including entities that process nonstandard health information they receive from another entity into a standard (as in standard electronic format or data content), or vice versa;</li></ul><p>and their business associates, meaning companies that</p><ul><li>help doctors get paid for providing healthcare;</li><li>assist with administering health plans;</li><li>store or destroy medical records; as well as</li></ul><p>external collaborators, such as legal counsels, accountants, and IT specialists.</p>

<h3>What type of emails do HIPAA rules and requirements cover? 3 examples of PHI shared via email</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>

<b>1. Emails to patients about their condition and treatment</b>

<p>The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows covered entities to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/570/does-hipaa-permit-health-care-providers-to-use-email-to-discuss-health-issues-with-patients/index.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">discuss health issues with patients</a> via email but requires them to apply reasonable safeguards when doing so. These include checking the recipient&#x2019;s email address before sending to avoid accidental PHI disclosures; limiting the amount of information shared when emailing PHI or treatment details unencrypted; and adopting the security standards set forth at <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164/subpart-C?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C.</a> </p>

<p>
<b>2. Bulk emails to past, present, or potential patients</b>
</p><p>Sending mass emails without blind copying recipients is the most common example of email-related HIPAA violations, regardless of what the message says. As long as the recipients can see who else has been emailed, they can infer a past, future or ongoing relationship between the healthcare provider and the addressees, which very much constitutes an impermissible disclosure of PHI.</p><p></p>

<p>
<b>3. Email replies from covered and non-covered entities</b>

</p><p>The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business associates to apply reasonable safeguards when emailing PHI. This requirement, however, doesn&#x2019;t extend to inbound email traffic. Meaning that protecting sensitive information in email replies is the responsibility of the sending party, as long as they too qualify as covered entities or business associates (if they don&#x2019;t, no HIPAA violation can be established).
</p>
<p></p>
</ol>

<h3>HIPAA for therapist emails: do the same rules apply? </h3>

<p>For the most part, yes.</p>

<p>As covered entities, mental health professionals must comply with HIPAA privacy and security standards just like any other health care provider. But <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hipaa-privacy-rule-and-sharing-info-related-to-mental-health.pdf?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">some exceptions apply</a>, for example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows communication between a healthcare provider and a patient&#x2019;s family and friends, who often play a critical role in the treatment process and outcomes.</p>

<p>In addition, psychotherapy notes are given special protections by the Privacy Rule as they contain extremely sensitive information and they&#x2019;re mostly relevant to the mental health professional who created them. For that reason, such notes must be kept separate from other types of PHI and can only be shared with the patient&#x2019;s express consent.</p>

<h3>HIPAA email encryption requirements: a short review</h3>

<p>According to the HIPAA Security Rule, encryption falls into the category of <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/2020/what-is-the-difference-between-addressable-and-required-implementation-specifications/index.html?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#x201C;addressable&#x201D; implementation specifications</a>. This does not translate as &#x201C;nice to have&#x201D; by a long shot.</p>

<p>Legislators worded these requirements vaguely, <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-encryption-requirements/?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HIPAA Journal explains</a>, to keep them technology-neutral and allow for future advancements in technology. Covered entities and business associates are advised to assess how and how often they transmit ePHI, and, based on their findings, if encryption is needed to protect ePHI in transit as well as what encryption methods would be best to protect the transmission.</p>

<p>The only instance where unencrypted protected health information transfer shouldn&#x2019;t raise any eyebrows is when it happens between colleagues through an organization&#x2019;s own secure network. Provided, of course, there are proper server security tools and protocols in place and only staff members who &#x201C;need to know&#x201D; the information to perform their job can read the plain text messages with no one else in the room.</p>

<p>Technically, sharing protected health information with patients via email can occur without encryption, but only if the covered entity has informed the recipient in advance and in full about the risks involved as well as about other, more secure ways of communication; the patient has stated that they opt for the less secure option despite the liabilities it poses and consent to this method of communication in a way that&#x2019;s documented and retrievable.</p>

<h3>How to make your emails HIPAA compliant?</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>

<b>1. Sign a BAA with your email provider</b>
<p>The purpose of the business associate contract (BAA) is to define the permissible uses and disclosures of PHI by the business associate and to ensure that administrative, physical, and technical safeguards will be used to protect it. Find a template by HHS <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sample-baa-hipaa.pdf?ref=tresorit.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. A word to the wise: if your email provider isn&#x2019;t willing to sign one, move on.</p>
<p></p>
<b>2. Use end-to-end encryption</b>
<p>End-to-end encryption can give users peace of mind even in an industry as tightly regulated as healthcare. It does so by encoding messages before they&#x2019;re sent and decoding them only after they arrive at a recipient&#x2019;s device using randomly generated encryption keys. This means that no one in the middle can read or modify them.</p>

<p></p>
<b>3. Enhance PHI security protocols</b>
<p>Devise and revise organizational policies related to PHI access, management, and transmission. Implement role-based permissions and granular controls to keep access to such information to the minimum necessary, along with access logs of who accessed or attempted to access PHI, and perform periodic log and permission audits.</p>

<b>Follow-up question #1: Is Gmail HIPAA-compliant? </b>

<p>Yes and no. The free version of Google&#x2019;s email service is not HIPAA-compliant as it&#x2019;s intended for personal use only. However, if you&#x2019;re a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity customer, you can configure Google services to support Gmail HIPAA compliance. To do so, make sure to sign a BAA with Google before you start using its services to transmit PHI, consult Google&#x2019;s HIPAA Implementation Guide and enable S/MIME encryption for your messaging.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Follow-up question #2: Is Outlook HIPAA-compliant? </b>

<p>Similarly to Google, Microsoft offers support with HIPAA compliance for enterprise users, who qualify as covered entities or business associates, and will enter into a BAA. That said, <a href="(link to HIPAA Journal)">HIPAA Journal points out</a>, the full range of features required to achieve HIPAA compliance, including audit logs, are only available for certain enterprise plans. Plus, services must be carefully configured and additional controls set up to make Outlook HIPAA-compliant.</p>
